## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my understanding of HTML structuring by creating a more organized and semantic markup. I also gained a better understanding of using CSS Flexbox to create a responsive and flexible layout. Specifically, I learned how to use Flexbox to center elements both horizontally and vertically, and how to create a mobile-first workflow to ensure a responsive design.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to continue to focus on improving my understanding of CSS Grid and how to use it in conjunction with Flexbox to create more complex and responsive layouts. I would also like to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as creating custom animations.
